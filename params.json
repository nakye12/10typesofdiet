You're probably familiar with its celeb endorsements—Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Hudson, and Jenny McCarthy are fans—and all the branded frozen foods at your local grocery store, but you'll love their new online platform that makes tracking your \"points\" easier than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"background-color:orange\">The best low calorie : The Volumetrics Diet</h2>\r\n<img src=\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Web images\\2.jpg\" alt=\"some_text\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<p>Salad bar lovers rejoice! With its emphasis on broth-based soups, large salads, and other \"high-volume, low-calorie\" foods, the Volumetrics Diet promises you'll lose weight without starving. A Smart Rating of 96 means experts love it for its emphasis on whole foods and veggies and dieters love it for the wide range of fiber-packed recipes that keep you full for hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"background-color:orange\">The best low carb: South Beach Diet</h2>\r\n<img src=\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Web images\\3.jpg\" alt=\"some_text\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<p>The South Beach Diet (Smart Rating 83) will have you slipping into your skinny jeans in no time, thanks to a high-protein, low-carb meal plan that is both \"approved and highly regarded by experts,\" according to WebMD. It's well-loved by non-nutritionists too: Former U.S. president Bill Clinton famously used it to drop harmful belly fat and cure him of his fast food addiction after poor health required open heart surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"background-color:orange\">The best government approved: The DASH Diet</h2>\r\n<img src=\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Web images\\4.jpg\" alt=\"some_text\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) has been giving Americans diet advice for decades (remember learning the Four Food Groups in elementary school? That was all NIH.), but when they released the DASH Diet, combining years of conventional weight-loss tips and research, experts were happy to note they'd added exercise and more sensible food options. With a Smart Rating of 97, doctors particularly recommend it for people looking to lower high blood pressure and reverse heart disease</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"background-color:orange\">The best for overall diet: The Mediterranean Diet</h2>\r\n<img src=\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Web images\\5.jpg\" alt=\"some_text\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<p>If you can't afford a cruise to the Mediterranean (yet!), at least you can eat like the famously beautiful and healthy people from the region. The Mediterranean Diet, Smart Rating 94, teaches you to eat like a Sicilian by incorporating more fish, olive oil, and veggies into your diet in order to maintain life-long health—whether you're trying to lose weight or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"background-color:orange\">The diet based on history: The Paleolithic Diet</h2>\r\n<img src=\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Web images\\6.jpg\" alt=\"some_text\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<p>Even though living like our distant ancestors doesn't sound like much fun (caves, stick toothbrushes, and pumas that aren't cute shoes? No thank you!), eating like them can be beneficial for both your health and waistline. The Paleolithic Diet, Smart Rating 62, offers to teach you how to eat \"how you were designed to eat\" by focusing on whole foods, fats, and no grains. The research on this (ironically) new diet is promising but still emerging. In the meantime, experts are happy that the diet focuses on natural foods, fitness, and sensible lifestyle changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"background-color:orange\">The vegeterian: The Ornish Diet</h2>\r\n<img src=\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Web images\\7.jpeg\" alt=\"some_text\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<p>Popularized by the recent documentary Forks Over Knives, the Ornish Diet, Smart Rating 90, focuses on whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and legumes to provide a low-fat, vitamin-packed way of eating. Best known for its charismatic and vocal founder, Dr. Dean Ornish, many followers have shared success stories about losing weight and improving overall health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"background-color:orange\">The best vegan: The Kind Diet</h2>\r\n<img src=\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Web images\\8.jpg\" alt=\"some_text\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<p>Looks like Alicia Silverstone isn't so clueless after all! With a Smart Rating of 80, her book The Kind Diet encourages a way of eating that's both gentle on your body and the environment. The diet focuses on eating a wide range of whole foods without using any animal products, but the real selling point may be that Alicia credits it for her luscious hair, glowing skin, and mellow attitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"background-color:orange\">The best for building lean muscle: Body for Life</h2>\r\n<img src=\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Web images\\9.jpg\" alt=\"some_text\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<p>Looks like Alicia Silverstone isn't so clueless after all!

But the new Eco Atkins Diet, with a Smart Rating of 68, aims to keep the nutritional goals the same while moving away from the all-meat-all-the-time mentality that made the original plan famous. Proponents love that with unlimited protein and fats, you rarely feel hungry. Plus, the Eco version includes vegetarian and vegan options so you don't have to sacrifice your principles for your waistline.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>",
